# Thompson-Sampling-for-general-stochastic-bandits
This is a project about Thompson Sampling for general stochastic bandits. It is applied to facilitate to enact maintenance policy and implement preventive maintenance actions on the repairable system when the maintenance effect is unknown. The source code is a simulation using Thompson Sampling for general stochastic bandits which can be found in the file TS.R.
